# Evaluation of some language identification models:

- *Input*: A piece of text (ranging from a single word to full documents).
- *Output*: A predicted language (e.g., English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese).

Task:
1. Find and study text datasets for language identification.
2. Evaluate all these datasets, then combine them together.
3. Find more State-of-the-Art (SotA) models for the task.
4. Evaluate these models using multiple metrics (including runtime performance) with the combined dataset.
5. Analyze the results.
